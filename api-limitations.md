## ‚ö†Ô∏è Free-Tier API Limitations

Please note that the **free-tier** of the QUEUEMAIL API has the following limitations:

- You can send up to **10,000 emails per month**, which is sufficient for most small to medium-sized projects.
- You can only use **your own SMTP servers** or **third-party providers** (e.g., Gmail, Outlook).  
  ‚ùå Access to Queuemail.dev professional SMTP servers is not included.
- **Logs are automatically deleted after 30 days.**
- All data is hosted in Queuemail's infrastructure.  
  ‚ùå You cannot configure your own infrastructure or database.
- **Standard queue processing** only (no priority or accelerated delivery).
- Accounts with no activity within the first 5 days of registration will be **automatically deleted**, including all associated data.  
  Likewise, any account that has not sent an email and has not connected within 5 days will be removed.  
  ‚úÖ Any account that has successfully sent at least one email will **not** be deleted.

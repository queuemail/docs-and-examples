#### You must consider our **API free-tier** has the following limitations:

- You can send up to 10,000 emails per month. This is quite a bit for most of small to medium projects.
- You can only use your SMTP servers or 3rd party SMTP servers (Google, Outlook, etc.). No access to Queuemail.dev professional SMTP severs.
- Logs are removed by 30 days.
- Data are hosted in our data infraestructure. No access to configure your own infraestructure (database).
- Normal queue processing (no priority for send emails faster).
- Registered accounts that are not used within the first 5 days will be automatically deleted and all associated data will be deleted. Also accounts that have not sent any email and do not connect for 5 days will be automatically deleted and all their associated data will be deleted. Any account that has successfully sent an email at any time will never be deleted.

#### For **professional use** we can offer a custom solution removing these limits:

- More emails per month.
- Access to Queuemail.dev professional SMTP servers (including option for sending with your own domain).
- No limit for logs retention.
- Host all your data in your own database (only you can access these data).
- Acelerated queue processing (emails are sent faster).
